Newspaper headlines: 'Police clashes tarnish vigil', and Kate's tributeUnder a headline: "Met chief faces calls to quit", the Sunday Telegraph says Dame Cressida Dick is facing cross-party fury after police clashed with women who had gathered on Clapham Common to mourn Sarah Everard. 
The paper speaks of violence erupting as police officers pulled women from the crowd, and of many denouncing as heavy-handed the force's approach to what had begun as a peaceful event. 
According to the Sunday Times, there is "outrage" that the vigil descended into "mayhem" and "chaos". 
It reports that trouble flared when the police moved in on the bandstand - where speeches were being made - causing bewilderment among the mainly female crowd. 
The Sun describes the scenes as "ugly" and "shocking". 
The Observer reports that other vigils took place in towns and cities across Britain. 
Mourners laid flowers and paid their respects, and while there was some police presence, there was no intervention by officers at these gatherings.
Most front pages carry a picture of the Duchess of Cambridge paying her respects to Ms Everard at the bandstand memorial on the south London common.
The Telegraph quotes royal sources as saying Catherine remembered "what it felt like to walk around London at night before she got married". 
The paper comments that the duchess was making a "not-so-subtle" statement, knowing her message would be received loud and clear by the likes of Boris Johnson, Priti Patel and Sadiq Khan. 
The Mail on Sunday describes her mingling with hundreds of tearful women in a "remarkable" and "touching expression of unity". 
The Sunday Mirror calls it a "solemn" visit, while the Sunday Express says the duchess looked "downcast".

According to the paper, a number of former and current royal aides, who were prevented from giving evidence in court during Meghan's recent successful privacy case, are likely to speak to the inquiry.
