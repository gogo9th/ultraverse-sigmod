Brit Awards: Griff, Pa Salieu and Rina Sawayama nominated for rising star prizeGriff, Pa Salieu and Rina Sawayama have been nominated for the Brits rising star award, which recognises pop's ones-to-watch for the coming year.
The prize, which was called critics choice until last year, has previously gone to Adele, Celeste and Jorja Smith.
Sawayama's nomination comes after the singer persuaded the Brits to change their eligibility rules last month.
The British-Japanese singer had been excluded because she didn't hold a British passport or dual citizenship.
New rules - announced on the day that voting for the rising star award opened - allow any artist who has been resident in the UK for more than five years to qualify for the main prizes. 
"I literally fell to the floor when I found out that I'd been nominated," said the singer. 
"I really can't put into words how much this means to me given that I wasn't eligible for this award a few weeks ago and now that door has been opened for future generations of artists like myself. 
"Thank you so much to everyone who voted for me, it means the world."
The winner of the rising star award will be announced on 19 March, ahead of the Brits ceremony - which has been delayed from February to 11 May, due to the pandemic.
