Covid symptoms: What are they and how do I protect myself?There are three main symptoms of coronavirus. If you get just one of them, you should get a test.
Public Health England says about 85% of people with Covid will have at least one. 
People infected with the new variant may be more likely to have a cough, sore throat, fatigue and muscle aches than people with the old variant, according to a recent ONS survey - and slightly less likely to lose their sense of taste or smell.
If you have any of these symptoms you should get a test as soon as possible and not leave home for any other reason. 
Anyone you live with, or who is in your support bubble, should also self-isolate until the test result arrives.
It takes five days on average from the moment you are infected to start showing the symptoms, but the World Health Organization says it can take up to 14 days.
If the test is positive, your whole household must all continue to follow self-isolation rules.
No. The coronavirus can affect multiple organs and has several less common symptoms.
Scientists using data on the health of four million people say Covid has six sub-types.
Symptoms include:
And researchers think that vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps could be a sign of coronavirus infection in children.
Lots of other viruses have similar symptoms to Covid, including flu and other infections. This will be a particular problem over winter when these bugs are more common. 
Public Health England says just under half of people who have one of the three main Covid symptoms will not have it.
However, they should still get a test.
If you have a positive test result you should self-isolate at home for at least 10 days from the time symptoms started.
You must stay away from other members of your household, who must self-isolate for at least 10 days.
Most people will have only mild symptoms, which can be managed with pain relief (like paracetamol), bed rest and plenty of fluids.
You should not even go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital.
If you are seriously unwell and you have a medical emergency you should call 999 - this includes feeling so breathless that you cannot speak more than a few words.
If you are concerned your symptoms are getting worse, use the NHS 111 website England, NHS Inform in Scotland or the equivalents in Wales and Northern Ireland.
The main reason people need hospital care is for difficulty breathing where they may be given oxygen.
The most seriously ill patients may require ventilation where the patient is sedated and air is pushed into their lungs.
Older people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure), are more likely to become severely ill. Men are at slightly higher risk of dying from the virus than women.
The best thing is regular and thorough hand washing, preferably with soap and water.
Coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can be breathed in, or cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on, then your eyes, nose or mouth. 
So, coughing and sneezing into tissues, not touching your face with unwashed hands, and avoiding close contact with infected people are important.
People will be most infectious when they have symptoms, but some may spread the virus even before they are sick.
Face coverings are also compulsory in many indoor settings across the UK.
