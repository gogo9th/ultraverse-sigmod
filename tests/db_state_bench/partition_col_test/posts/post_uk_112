Covid-19: Tickets for England fans in Italy, and scrapping school bubblesHere are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. 
England football fans are being told not to travel to Italy to watch their side face Ukraine in the Euros quarter final on Saturday, since Italy's Covid rules mean they'd have to quarantine and miss the match. Because of this, the FA - which has been allocated 2,560 tickets for the match - has decided not to sell tickets the normal way, and instead is in talks with Uefa to try to sell them to English nationals living in Italy. The FA were keen to have the maximum number of England fans, our sport reporter said. Meanwhile, new figures for Scotland show nearly 2,000 Covid cases have been linked to people watching football. Two thirds of cases were fans who travelled to London for Scotland's game with England.
Currently, rules in schools mean that pupils are kept in groups - or bubbles - and if someone in that group tests positive for Covid then everyone else in the bubble must self-isolate. Figures earlier this week showed there had been a sharp rise in pupils sent home to isolate, and now Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has told MPs he wants the system scrapped as soon as possible. He said they could be removed as part of the next step of lockdown easing in England, currently scheduled for 19 July. 
Earlier Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer challenged the PM over why he didn't sack former Health Secretary Matt Hancock when he broke Covid rules. He brought up the case of Ollie Bibby, who was not allowed to see his family as he died of leukaemia in hospital in May, a day before Mr Hancock was filmed kissing a colleague in violation of Covid regulations. "It's one rule for them, another rule for everyone else," said Sir Keir. In response, Boris Johnson said everyone shared the Bibby family's grief but that the government was focusing on vaccines, rather than "on stuff going on within the Westminster bubble". Ollie's mum Penny said his reply made her family feel "not important".
Around 200 Spanish students are being held under police guard at a hotel in Majorca, after an outbreak of more than 1,000 Covid cases. The authorities have linked the spike to trips by teenagers from the Spanish mainland who are celebrating the end of the school year. Students have been taken to a quarantine hotel and police are monitoring them with 24-hour surveillance. "We are afraid, because they haven't told us how long we are going to be trapped here," says Luc√≠a Cano, 17. It comes as holidays to Majorca from the UK have become easier, as the Balearics are now on the green list.
Nearly half of Australia's population - more than 12 million people - are under new stay-at-home orders after a slight case rise of nearly 200 cases. Seven Australian cities including Sydney, Brisbane, Perth, Darwin, Townsville and the Gold Coast are now in lockdown as authorities scramble to prevent the spread of the highly-contagious Delta variant. State leaders said they were facing a "pressure cooker situation" as new cases emerged. The move comes after a slow vaccination rollout with just 5% of the population being fully vaccinated.
