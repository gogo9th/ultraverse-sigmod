Brexit: What's the Northern Ireland Protocol?Sausages will continue to be allowed into Northern Ireland from Great Britain after the EU agreed to postpone a ban affecting some British meats.
The problem for bangers, burgers and other chilled meats are hidden in the detail of a Brexit deal known as the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Following Brexit, Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) no longer follows EU rules on product standards (which are the same for all countries in the EU single market). But Northern Ireland does - partly because it shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member.
Under EU food safety rules, chilled meat products are not allowed to enter the single market from non-member countries such as the UK. 
That means sending sausages from Great Britain to Northern Ireland is - in theory - no longer allowed.
However, a grace period has been in place since January where the rules don't apply. 
That period, due to end on 30 June, has now been extended until 30 September, but there is still no agreement on how to resolve the dispute in the long term. 
The UK had previously warned it was ready to ignore the rules if an extension was not granted, even though it signed up to them when it negotiated the Northern Ireland Protocol. 
The Northern Ireland Protocol helps prevent checks along the land border between Northern Ireland (in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (in the EU).
During Brexit negotiations, all sides agreed protecting the 1998 Northern Ireland peace deal (the Good Friday agreement) was an absolute priority. 
Part of that meant keeping the land border open and avoiding new infrastructure such as cameras and border posts. 
This was easy to do when both Ireland and Northern Ireland were part of the EU, because they automatically shared the same EU rules on trade and no checks were needed on goods travelling from one country to another.
However, a new arrangement was needed after Brexit. The EU requires many goods - such as milk and eggs - to be inspected when they arrive from non-EU countries, while some products aren't allowed to enter at all.
This was why they negotiated and signed up to the Northern Ireland Protocol.
It came into force on 1 January 2021, and is now part of international law.  
To avoid checks on goods along the Irish border, it was agreed some would be carried out instead when they entered Northern Ireland from England, Scotland or Wales.
Inspections take place at Northern Ireland ports, and customs documents have to be filled in. 
This has prompted criticism that a new border has effectively been created in the Irish Sea.
The new system got off to a shaky start, with some disruption at the beginning of the year. 
The EU said in February the control posts were not yet fully operational and some goods were entering Northern Ireland without being properly declared.
To make sure supplies were maintained, supermarkets were allowed to avoid having products checked for three months. This was separate to the grace period for chilled meats.
But in March, the UK decided - by itself - to extend this grace period for supermarkets until October, and announced further unilateral moves, to make the trade in parcels and plants from GB to Northern Ireland easier.
The EU has said these UK decisions break international law, because it wasn't consulted. It has launched legal action which could end up with the European Court of Justice imposing substantial fines on the UK.
The European Commission has now taken further steps to modify the implementation of the Protocol. 
It has agreed measures to make it easier to move guide dogs and livestock from GB to Northern Ireland, and has proposed a change in EU law to guarantee the supply of medicines. 
It is also removing the need for British vehicles to have a "green card" insurance certificate when they are driven across the border into the EU. 
But the Commission emphasised it is not issuing a blank cheque, and it expects other rules to be followed.
As well as problems with trade, there are also political and security concerns.
Checks were temporarily suspended in February, over what were described as "sinister" threats to some border staff checking goods.
Unionists are strongly opposed to the checks because they don't want Northern Ireland to be treated differently to the rest of the UK. In March, one group wrote to the Prime Minister to withdraw support for the Good Friday agreement. 
There have also been a series of demonstrations and protests against any kind of border in the Irish Sea. 
Speaking after a meeting with President Biden on 10 June, Boris Johnson said there was "complete harmony on the need to keep going, find solutions and make sure we uphold the Belfast Good Friday Agreement".
The UK says the Protocol has to be implemented in a "pragmatic and proportionate" way. 
But many issues remain unresolved.
