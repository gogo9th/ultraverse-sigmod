Covid vaccine: How many people in the UK have been vaccinated so far?More than 23 million people in the UK have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine - part of the biggest inoculation programme the country has ever launched.
In a race against a faster-spreading variant of the virus, ministers have pinned their hopes of easing a third national lockdown on vaccinating as many adults as possible by summer. 
The UK government aims to offer a first vaccine dose to about 32 million people in nine priority groups by 15 April.
The programme in England is now inviting those aged 56 and above to book appointments after the first four groups - those aged 70 and over, care home residents, healthcare workers and people required to shield - were offered a jab by mid-February. The rest of the over-50s will follow.
These groups account for 88% of deaths so far.

The over 65s in Scotland, the over 60s in Northern Ireland and the over 50s in Wales have been asked to book appointments.
From spring, the government then plans to begin vaccinating the rest of the adult population in age order, another 21 million people. 
People in their 40s will be next, once the current phase is completed.
More than 23 million people so far have had a first vaccine dose and about 1.4 million have had a second.
The number of first doses administered each day had been steadily climbing since December - reaching more than 400,000 a day mid-February.
However, the current seven-day average for first doses is about 280,000 doses a day.
Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi told MPs this week that although supply had been "finite" until now, the country would see a "big uplift" in available doses in the second half of March - amounting to tens of millions of jabs. 
This would mean a "rapid increase" in the number of vaccines administered, he said.
The campaign to reach as many people as quickly as possible was boosted by a shift in policy in early January - to prioritise the first dose of a vaccine, with a second dose up to 12 weeks later, a bigger gap than originally planned.
The progress made in the UK so far means the country continues to be among those with the highest vaccination rates globally.
There has been some regional variation in the vaccination rollout, but most areas are now reaching high proportions of those in priority age groups.
Scotland has administered first doses to about 85% of its over 60s, while Wales has reached 81% and Northern Ireland 67%. 
There is little variation across the English regions, which have each vaccinated around 90% of the same age group, apart from London, which has reached 82%.
There have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas.
Analysis of NHS records by the OpenSAFELY group - a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a vaccine among three of the older age groups.
The study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data.   
In addition, 89% of those aged 80 and over in the poorest areas had been given a vaccine by 24 February compared with 96% in the most affluent areas.
When looking for evidence for whether the campaign is working, data for England shows coronavirus numbers are falling faster for vaccinated groups compared with unvaccinated groups. 
This suggests that the vaccine is starting to push numbers down, instead of as a result other factors, like the lockdown. 
On average, deaths of over-65s fell by 63% between 19 February-5 March, compared with 53% for under-65s.
Coronavirus hospital admissions are also falling faster for older age groups.
We would expect this effect to become stronger over time - but this might take several weeks, and significant population coverage.
The UK is currently receiving doses of two vaccines approved by the medicine regulator. 
The Pfizer-BioNTech jab - the first to be given the green light in December - is being imported from Puurs, Belgium. 
A second vaccine, from Oxford University and AstraZeneca, is being made in Britain by two biotech companies: Oxford BioMedica, based in Oxford; and Cobra Biologics, based at Keele Science Park, Staffs. 
Another company, Wockhardt, based in Wrexham, fills the vials and packages them for use.
Supplies of a third vaccine to be approved, made by US company Moderna, will come from Europe but are not expected to be available until later next month.
The UK is also lined up to receive at least three other vaccines if they are approved for use.
A jab manufactured by US firm Novavax will be made in Stockton-on-Tees in north-east England, while another by French company Valneva will be made in Livingston, West Lothian, Scotland.
The third, by Belgian firm Janssen, owned by Johnson & Johnson, should also be available later this year.
People will be vaccinated in three main ways, at: 
The government has urged the public to "play their part" in supporting "the largest vaccination programme in British history", including helping people attend their appointments.
The UK has ordered more than 400 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines.
Three have so far been approved for use: Oxford-AstraZeneca; Pfizer-BioNTech; and Moderna.
The UK government has also announced an eighth deal with biopharmaceutical company CureVac to develop vaccines against future variants.
It has placed an initial order for 50 million doses to be delivered later this year - if they are required.
But there have been a number of challenges in what is called the vaccine "supply chain" - the logistics of how the jab gets from manufacturers to people.
Getting enough supplies, checking those supplies are up to scratch and transporting vaccines according to their requirements have all thrown up difficulties.
