Covid: First death recorded on Isle of Man in four monthsThe Isle of Man has recorded its first death from Covid-19 in more than four months.
The only detail the government would release about the person to have died was that they were of an "older age".
It takes the total number of Manx people to have died with the virus to 26.
The latest figures showed there were 704 infections on the island after 66 new cases were identified.
Twelve people are receiving treatment in Noble's Hospital, with one in intensive care.
Chief Minister Howard Quayle said the death was "a blow to our community" and a "painful reminder of how dangerous this virus is".
"I am sure the thoughts of everyone on our island will be with this person's family and loved ones, to whom I extend my condolences," he added.
The most recent death on the island had been recorded on 5 November, and at the time it was the first for almost six months.
The island's third lockdown began on 3 March amid a fresh surge in cases which is continuing.
A total of 1,157 people have tested positive for the virus on the island since the start of the pandemic.
