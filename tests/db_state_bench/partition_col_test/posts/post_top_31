Covid: How are European countries tackling the pandemic?Most European countries introduced lockdown measures at the start of the year, to fight new peaks in infections and deaths.
While some are starting to ease restrictions, others are extending lockdowns or introducing new regional measures. 
France has a curfew between 18:00 and 06:00. Shops and businesses must be closed, and everyone must be at home.
Schools are open with extra testing in place. Bars, restaurants, theatres, cinemas and ski resorts remain shut.
France closed its borders to all non-EU countries from 31 January, although hauliers are exempt. 
In addition to nationwide restrictions, weekend lockdown measures are place in parts of the French Riviera, including Nice and Cannes, as well as parts of the north coast. 
People need written permission stating the reason for being out from Friday evening to Monday morning. 
Germany has started lifting some restrictions in place since mid-December. 
In most German states, shops and museums are allowed to reopen, but the exact rules on how many visitors they are allowed are dependent on the local infection rate. 
People from one household can meet with another household in private, but this is limited to five adults plus children. 
Hairdressers have reopened already and cosmetics and nail bars, beauty salons, massage and tattoo studios can reopen from 8 March.

A strict lockdown since November helped to contain a new surge in infections, and in January, nurseries and primary schools, as well as shops, were allowed to reopen. 
But from late January, in areas with high infection rates - the "red zones", which include Athens - new lockdown measures were imposed. Non-essential shops, schools, hairdressers and beauty salons, are once again closed. 
In Athens, Thessaloniki and Chalkidiki, a curfew from 21:00 to 05:00 is in place during the week and from 18:00 to 05:00 at the weekend, while in other "red zones" the curfew starts at 18:00.

Secondary school students have been allowed to return to some in-person lessons, but in red zones (currently three out of Italy's 20 regions) all schools and nurseries are closed.
Restaurants and museums in red zones are also closed. In yellow zones, bars and restaurants can now once again serve customers at tables and counters until 18:00. 
In orange zones, restaurants and bars are closed except for takeaways.

Denmark has been in a lockdown since December, when all shops and other businesses were closed, apart from supermarkets and pharmacies. Schools were open only for younger primary school children.

Sweden tried to avoid imposing rules when other countries were in lockdown, but on 10 January a new emergency law came into effect.
