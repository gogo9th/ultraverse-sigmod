Coronavirus: When can we stop wearing face masks or coverings?Reviews are considering how face-covering rules might change in future. 
Meanwhile, a study has found higher quality FFP3 masks give healthcare workers more protection against Covid. 
Reviews are assessing how and when a range of Covid measures might be lifted, including the need for face coverings. 
The Social Distancing Review is one of four different UK Government studies into how Covid-19 should be handled from "summer onwards".
Mask-use will also be considered by the other three reviews looking at:
The Westminster government is working with counterparts in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on a UK-wide approach.
Each review will inform ministers deciding when England's final stage of lifting lockdown can happen.
It had been hoped remaining restrictions could be removed on 21 June, but they will remain in place until in England at least 19 July because of the Delta variant.
We won't know for sure until ministers assess the reviews, but it's thought face-coverings might still be needed in some circumstances - particularly during winter. 
Some people may opt to wear them, even if they are not compulsory.
Former Health Secretary Matt Hancock previously said he hoped they would become the norm on public transport as a matter of "personal responsibility".
But Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Environment Secretary George Eustice have both said they plan to stop wearing face coverings as soon as rules are relaxed. 
Face coverings worn over the nose and mouth reduce the spread of coronavirus droplets from coughs, sneezes and speaking.
The main purpose is to protect others from Covid, rather than yourself. If everyone wears one, the risks drop for all.
Masks can help to reduce virus spread from people who may be contagious but have no symptoms.
There is some evidence they offer protection to wearers, but are not a replacement for social distancing and hand-washing.
Cutting virus transmission is important because many people are still not yet fully vaccinated.
Also, some new virus variants appear more transmissible than earlier Covid strains.
Make sure it:
The highest level of protection is provided by FFP3 (or similar) masks worn by healthcare workers in high risk settings.
Trained staff need to fit them correctly. They are worn in conjunction with other personal protective equipment (gloves, aprons, eye protection). 
A recent study by Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust found FFP3 masks provided up to 100% protection against Covid. 
Staff wearing standard issue surgical masks, as recommended in official guidance for most situations, were much more likely to catch the virus. 
Members of the public can buy FFP3 masks, but they won't provide the highest protection unless fitted correctly. 
You could be fined if you refuse to wear one in many public places in England, including public transport and shops. 
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have similar rules.
Police can issue £200 fines England and Northern Ireland, or £60 in Scotland and Wales.
Some people don't have to wear face coverings, including:
The BBC has created a make-your-own face covering guide. 
The government has issued advice too.
