Covid map: Coronavirus cases, deaths, vaccinations by countryCovid-19 is continuing to spread around the world, with nearly 120 million confirmed cases and 2.6 million deaths across nearly 200 countries.
The US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by Russia, the UK and a number of European countries. 
Very few places have been left untouched.
In the table below, countries can be reordered by deaths, death rate and total cases. In the coloured bars on the right-hand side, countries in which cases have risen to more than 10,000 per day are those with black bars on the relevant date.
Note: The map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for figures for France and the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University, which results in a slightly lower overall total. US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands.
Confirmed cases have been rising steeply since the middle of last year, but the true extent of the first outbreaks in 2020 is unclear because testing was not then widely available.
The 100 millionth coronavirus case was recorded at the end of January - about a year after the first officially diagnosed case of the virus.
Deaths have also been rising, however official figures may not fully reflect the true number in many countries. 
Data on excess deaths, a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years, may give a better indication of the actual numbers in many cases.
Several coronavirus vaccines against the virus have now been approved for use, either by individual countries or groups of countries, such as the European Union and the World Health Organization (WHO). 
Of the 114 countries and territories administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, 60 are high-income nations, 53 are middle-income and one low-income. 
The map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses.
Overall, the US and China have given the most doses, 98 million and 53 million respectively, while India has administered more than 26 million so far. 
But when breaking the figures down by population, looking at doses administered per 100 people in the 10 countries giving the most vaccinations, Israel, the UK and the US top the list.
Most countries are prioritising the over-60s, health workers and people who are clinically vulnerable. 
Some countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine.
Several African countries have received vaccines through the Covax initiative, with vaccinations now underway in Ghana, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Kenya and Rwanda, among others.
As populations across the world await widespread vaccine rollout, cases are either stable or falling in most regions at the moment.
Here's a breakdown of the situation by region:
Europe
Daily cases had been falling in most European countries earlier this month, but several are now seeing a rise in infections.
France, Italy, Poland and Turkey have seen the highest numbers in recent weeks.
Lockdown measures were tightened in many of the worst-affected countries over the winter but some restrictions are now being lifted.
North America
The US has recorded nearly 30 million cases and about 530,000 deaths, the highest figures in the world.
Daily cases were at record levels in early January but they have fallen substantially in the last few weeks. 
Canada, which has a far lower death rate than the US, also experienced a winter surge. Daily cases there fell in January before levelling off in March. 
Asia
Asia was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from China in early 2020, but the number of cases and deaths there has been lower than in Europe and North America. 
The region saw a large rise in the number of cases last autumn, driven by a surge in infections in India. 
India has seen more than 11 million confirmed cases, the second-highest in the world after the US, and daily infections appear to be on the rise again. 
Middle East
Several countries in the Middle East have had deadly coronavirus outbreaks over the past 12 months, with Iran and Israel having seen the highest numbers. 
Cases have fallen in Israel but several countries, including Iran, Jordan and Iraq, are currently seeing renewed outbreaks. 
Israel's vaccination programme has been highly successful in reducing the number of cases there. 
Africa
Africa has recorded more than four million cases and 100,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic in many African countries is not known as testing rates are low.
South Africa, with more than 1.5 million cases, is the worst affected country on the continent, according to official figures. 
Morocco, Egypt, Ethiopia, Tunisia, Libya, Algeria, Nigeria and Kenya have also recorded more than 100,000 cases.
Latin America
In Latin America, there has been particular concern about soaring infection rates in Brazil.
The country has more than 11 million confirmed cases and 270,000 deaths - the world's second highest death toll.
On Thursday, Brazil recorded more than 2,000 Covid-related deaths in a single day for the first time.
Argentina, Colombia and Mexico have all recorded more than two million cases while Peru has seen more than one million.
The UN has said that more than 20 million people across Latin America and the Caribbean have been pushed into poverty during the pandemic.
Oceania
Australia and New Zealand have been praised for their response to the pandemic, with both countries having seen comparatively few deaths. 
In a sign of how effective their lockdown measures have been, the average number of cases in both countries is similar to that in French Polynesia, a sprawling network of islands in the Pacific Ocean.
Most other islands in the region have seen at least a few cases.
Papua New Guinea is currently the worst-affected country in the region after seeing a recent spike in cases. 
Covid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020.
It was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.
A pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time.
The data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University, data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, national governments and health agencies, as well as UN data on populations.
When comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.
Other factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.
