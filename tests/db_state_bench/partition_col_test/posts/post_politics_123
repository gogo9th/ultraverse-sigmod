Firms urged to give staff time off for England gameStaff should be allowed to finish work early to watch England take on Germany, Sir Keir Starmer has said.
The Labour leader's comments come after the Trade Union Congress (TUC) urged employers to be flexible in allowing workers time off to follow the Euro 2020 clash, which starts at 17:00 BST.
TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said bosses being flexible can cut absences and boost productivity.
She added staff could make up any lost time at a later date.
Sir Keir tweeted to wish Gareth Southgate's side good luck ahead of the last-16 clash against Germany, before he added: "Staff should be allowed to finish early so they can watch the match."
The TUC's Ms Frances, who is an Arsenal and England fan, said: "Millions of workers around the UK will want to cheer on their national teams in Euro 2020 - especially after the tournament was postponed last year.
"Bosses should talk to their staff and try and let people who want to watch the games do so, either at work or at home - and then claim back their time afterwards.   
"Whether it's about major sporting events like Euro 2020, attending a medical appointment or picking up the kids from school, allowing people more flexibility in how and when they do their work makes them happier."
Law firm Levins Solicitors tweeted it was shutting at 4pm so staff could watch the England match.  
Robin Flett, a senior partner at Levins Solicitors in Liverpool, told the BBC he had planned to leave the office to watch the game himself, and thought it would be "very mean spirited" if he left his staff to continue working.
"It's been a very tough 15 months with lockdown, there is no good news at all," he said.
"We just thought it was a good idea. We have a fantastic staff, they have worked extremely hard. 
"Times have been very testing and this is just one little bit of light."
Schools Minister Nick Gibb said staff being allowed to leave work early for the game was "really a matter for industry and for business".
"I'll have to be in a debate on the estimates in the House of Commons when the football starts," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
Asked if his own staff at the Department for Education could finish early, he added: "Civil servants have a very demanding job and I'm sure they'll be able the juggle the demands of being a civil servant with being able to sneak a glimpse."
The TUC estimated more than one in five UK employees, 5.8 million people, work evenings and weekends.
The union suggested bosses talk with employees about "arrangements for key games" now the tournament has entered the knockout stages.
It suggested either allowing staff to watch the game on the company's premises or from home.
