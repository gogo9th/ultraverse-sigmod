Batley and Spen by-election: Labour 'egged and kicked'Labour activists campaigning ahead of the Batley and Spen by-election have been pelted with eggs and kicked in the head, the region's mayor has said.
Tracy Brabin said she was leafleting for Labour in Batley on Sunday, when her group was "followed, verbally abused and physically assaulted".
The West Yorkshire mayor and former Batley and Spen MP said campaigners included young people and the elderly.
West Yorkshire Police has issued an image of a man wanted over the attacks.
The force said it sought to speak to the man in relation to eggs being thrown at canvassers in Whitaker Street, Batley, at about 16.30 BST on Sunday.
It said four offences of assault had been recorded, including one in which a man suffered minor injuries from being punched and kicked.
The force said it believed three suspects, described as Asian men wearing hooded tops, were involved.
