Covid-19 in the UK: How many coronavirus cases are there in your area?There have been more than 4.2 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and over 125,000 people have died, government figures show. 
However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus.
More than 23 million people in the UK have now had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine.
Correction: On Friday this graphic erroneously showed UK total cases as 4,428,286. The correct figure was 4,248,286.

The average number of new daily cases in the UK has fallen substantially in recent weeks, and strict lockdown measures are beginning to be eased. 
A further 5,534 confirmed cases across the UK were announced by the government on Saturday. 
This is down from 6,040 new cases a week earlier.
The UK's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty warned this week that the fight against the virus is far from finished.
"A lot of people may think this is all over. It is very easy to forget how quickly things can turn bad," he said.
It is thought the infection rate was much higher than was evident from the reported number of cases during the first peak in spring last year. Testing capacity was too limited to detect the true number of daily cases.
The orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people.
With millions of children returning to school in England, UK nations are moving to the next stages of easing restrictions on everyday life.
In Wales, where younger primary-age children are back in school, the "stay at home rule" has become "stay local" and four people from two different households can meet up outdoors to socialise. 
Younger children have also begun returning to school in Scotland, with the government there hoping to lift the stay-at-home restriction on 5 April.
In Northern Ireland, children will begin a phased return to school this month, and other restrictions will be reviewed on 16 March.
More than 23.6 million people have now received a first dose of a vaccine - around a third of the population - and more than 1.4 million people have had a second.
The current seven-day average for first doses is around 269,000 doses a day - down from more than 400,000 a day in early February. 
This drop in first doses can be partially explained by an increase in the number of second doses now being administered. 
But Health Secretary Matt Hancock has also blamed the reduction on supply issues.
In total, just over 20 million people in England have had one vaccine dose. 
In Scotland, about 1.8 million people have had their first dose, while the figure is just over one million in Wales and more than 620,000 in Northern Ireland.
The government is aiming to offer a vaccine to everyone in the top nine priority groups, including care home residents, healthcare workers, people required to shield and everyone aged 50 and over, by 15 April.
After that, the rest of the adult population will be vaccinated, with people prioritised by age. 
All adults in the UK are expected to be offered their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine by the end of July.
A further 121 deaths across the UK within 28 days of a positive test were reported on Saturday.
This is down from 158 deaths a week earlier.
Of the most recently reported deaths, 106 were in England, eight in Scotland, six in Wales and one in Northern Ireland.
Rules were amended last summer to include deaths in the coronavirus total only if they occurred within 28 days of a positive test. Previously in England, all deaths after a positive test were included.
England has seen the majority of UK deaths from Covid-19. Using the 28-day cut-off, there have been more than 110,000.  
There are currently just over 8,000 people with coronavirus in hospital in the UK.
Numbers in mid-January reached almost double the highest point of the peak last spring, but have been falling since then.
London, the South East and the Midlands saw the highest numbers in recent weeks, but patient numbers are falling in all UK nations and regions now. 
But everywhere saw more patients in hospital in the winter surge than during the first wave last spring.
When looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number.
First, government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus - and that total is now over 125,000.
Second, ONS figures include all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. This figure is more than 140,000 deaths, to 26 February.
The third measure counts all deaths over and above the usual number at the time of year - that figure was more than 120,000 by 26 February.
In total, there were 14,281 deaths registered  in the week to 26 February, which is down on last week but still 9% higher than "normal" for the time of year. 
Of that figure, 3,196 deaths were related to coronavirus - down by just over a quarter from the previous week.
There have now been more deaths involving Covid than "excess" deaths, which means non-Covid deaths must be below usual levels. 
This could be because of a milder flu season - resulting from less travel and more social distancing - and because some people who might have died for other reasons had there been no pandemic, died of Covid.
The "R number" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. 
If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. 
The government's current estimate for the R number across the whole of the UK is 0.6 to 0.8.
The estimates for England and Scotland are currently 0.6 to 0.8, in Wales it is 0.7 to 0.9 and in Northern Ireland it is 0.75 to 0.95.
The government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions.
