Norwich MP Chloe Smith announces she is clear of breast cancerAn MP diagnosed with breast cancer has said she is now clear of the disease. 
Chloe Smith, 38, Conservative MP for Norwich North, announced on social media that she was free of the illness, first diagnosed in October by her GP. 
"Cheerio, cancer! After chemotherapy and surgery, I've not got breast cancer any more," she posted on Twitter. 
Ms Smith, who is married with two children, has been a Norwich MP since 2009 and is also the minister for constitution and devolution.
Speaking to the BBC, Ms Smith said: "So many people have been so loving and supportive and kind to me." 
Her advice to others who might be facing cancer was "to try and stay positive".
"I'm lucky in that I find it easier to be an optimist than a pessimist; that's just my character. 
"But I've had to really dig deep and find determination and resilience and it's been a tough old time. But looking to the future, I feel hopeful and happier." 
A statement about her return to full health has been published on her website.
In it, she wrote: "I want to thank the NHS doctors and nurses for the careful and expert treatment I've had, and for the steps still ahead in recovery and prevention."
In November the MP was given the "good news" that her cancer had not spread since the initial diagnosis.
Her recovery was welcomed by political colleagues, including the Bury St Edmunds MP, Jo Churchill, who has previously suffered from thyroid and breast cancer. 
Since developing the disease, Ms Smith has encouraged others to check for signs of cancer. 
"If you find anything unusual, please call your GP straight away," said Ms Smith, who said she saw her own doctor within half an hour of finding a lump. 
Ms Smith said she managed to continue to work while receiving treatment thanks to the support of her constituency office.
She would be "returning to duties in person where essential, starting with constituency meetings".
When Ms Smith won her seat in a by-election in 2009 at the age of 27, she was the youngest sitting MP.
She then became the youngest minister in government at the age of 29.
