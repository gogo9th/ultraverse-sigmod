Euro 2020 and Covid: How can I watch with my friends?Groups of fans celebrated England's Euro win over Germany in pubs, on the streets and at home on Tuesday.
It's a scene that may be repeated during Saturday's quarter-final against Ukraine, but guidance and rules still remain in place to stop the spread of Covid.
Pubs have been given a lot of guidance by industry bodies in order to ensure Covid-safety. Among the factors they're being asked to consider are: 
In England, up to six people from six households (or two households of any size) can meet in a pub, or 30 in a pub garden.
In Wales, up to six people from six households can meet inside a pub. Up to 30 people can meet in a pub garden.
In Scotland, it depends which Covid alert level your area is in:
In level two areas of Scotland, including Euro 2020 host city Glasgow, pubs must operate two-hour pre-booked slots and close indoors at 22:30 BST.
In Northern Ireland, up to six people from two households (or any number from one household) can sit together inside. The rules are the same if you are in a pub garden.
In all nations, social distancing guidelines should be followed and face coverings worn in pubs when not sitting down. 
The social distancing review - what you need to know
Each nation has different rules.
If you are inside, you should keep rooms well-ventilated, maintain social distancing and wash your hands regularly.

Looking further ahead, Wembley will play host to both semi-finals and the final.
