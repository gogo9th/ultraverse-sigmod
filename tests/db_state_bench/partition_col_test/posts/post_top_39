Coronavirus: When will pubs, hairdressers and gyms open?The first stage of easing England's lockdown has taken place with the reopening of schools to all pupils. 
Services like pubs, hairdressers and gyms are not due to restart until the middle of April.
Pubs and restaurants could reopen in England from 12 April, but they will only be able to offer outdoor service at this point.
There will be no 22:00 curfew, and customers will not be asked to order a substantial meal alongside alcoholic drinks.
They will however, be required to order, and to eat and drink, while seated, and may also have to wear a mask when not at their table. 
From 17 May, customers could be allowed to eat and drink inside. The table service rule will remain in place.
Outdoor sport facilities, such as tennis and basketball courts and open air swimming pools will be allowed to reopen on 29 March in England.
On the same day, meeting-up rules will also be relaxed - with up to six people allowed to gather outdoors. However, people from different households will still need to socially distance from each other.
Formally organised outdoor sports - for adults and children - can also restart and will not be subject to the gatherings limits. However, people will need to follow guidance issued by organisers. 
Hairdressers and nail salons - along with non-essential retail and libraries - will be allowed to open on 12 April at the earliest.
To begin with, you will only be allowed to get your hair cut alone or with other members of your household. You will also need to continue to follow social distancing rules.
People who offer so-called "close contact" services in the home - such as mobile hairdressers and massage therapists - will also be able to return to work, as long as they follow the relevant government guidance.
Gyms and other types of indoor leisure could open from 12 April.
Initially, you will only be allowed to visit gyms alone or with other members of your household. Gyms and other businesses will also need to make sure social distance rules are followed to reduce the risk of transmission.
Indoor group exercises classes will not be allowed until at least 17 May.
The majority of outdoor settings and attractions - such as zoos, theme parks, drive-in cinemas - could open from 12 April.
The rules on social contact outdoors will apply in these settings.
Some theatre performances, concerts and sports events could be allowed to open from 17 May.
Indoor events will be allowed to host up to 1,000 people or 50% of a venue's capacity, whichever is lower. Outdoor events will be allowed to have 4,000 people or 50% capacity, whichever is lower.
The government will also make special provision for large, outdoor, seated venues where crowds can be safely spaced, allowing up to 10,000 people or 25% of total seated capacity, whichever is lower.
Going to larger events above capacity limits and nightclubs could be allowed from 21 June.
In Scotland, the government hopes to reopen pubs and restaurants, as well as gyms, swimming pools, leisure facilities, non-essential retail and salons on 26 April, if circumstances allow. More detail on the plan is expected in mid-March.
Wales and Northern Ireland have not yet announced any dates for the reopening of these venues.
