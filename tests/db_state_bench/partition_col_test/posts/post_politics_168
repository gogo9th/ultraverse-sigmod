Covid: What's the roadmap for lifting lockdown?There is "no reason" for England's final Covid restrictions to last beyond 19 July, new Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said.
Scotland aims to lift all major legal lockdown restrictions by 9 August. The next review of measures in Wales is due on 15 July. Some rules in Northern Ireland will be reviewed on 1 July.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said people in England are "very likely" to be able to return to "pretty much life before Covid" on 19 July.
The final stage was put back by four weeks from 21 June, because of the spread of the Delta variant. The government said more time was needed to vaccinate the adult population. 
The remaining restrictions include the rule of six, table service in pubs and restaurants, nightclubs being closed and capacity limits in theatres and cinemas.
Ministers also have to consider the findings of reviews on face coverings and social distancing before deciding when all limits could be lifted.
