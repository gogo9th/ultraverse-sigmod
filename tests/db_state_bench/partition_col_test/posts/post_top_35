Covid: What are the new rules for schools?Children in England are returning to school, after months of enforced home-schooling. 
It is hoped they will soon be followed by pupils in other parts of the UK.
Students in England will be tested for Covid-19 three times in the first two weeks of school. After that they will be given two tests each week to use at home. 
These will be lateral flow tests, which involve taking a swab of the nose and throat. The sample is put in a tube of liquid and gives a result within 30 minutes. 
Testing is voluntary and children will only be tested if a parent or carer gives consent. Pupils will not be stopped from returning to school if they do not take part.
Staff or pupils who test positive should self-isolate. If the test is done at home, they should also book a second test at a local test centre to confirm the result.
You should not send your child to school or college if they:
All primary and secondary school staff are also being offered twice-weekly rapid tests, and parents and carers can also get a twice-weekly test. 
In Scotland, all teaching staff as well as senior phase pupils (S4 and above) will be offered home tests twice a week. 
All school staff in Wales will also be offered twice-weekly rapid tests.  
Students and teachers at special schools in Northern Ireland are being offered weekly tests. 
Students and staff in English secondary schools, colleges, and universities have to wear face coverings indoors - including in classrooms - unless 2m (6ft) social distancing can be maintained. This will be reviewed at Easter.
The rules do not apply to younger children in nurseries and primary schools, but adults should wear face coverings where possible.
Some students and adults may be exempt - such as those who cannot use a face covering because of a disability or illness, and those who rely on lip-reading and facial expressions to communicate.
From 15 March, as part of the second phase of schools returning in Scotland, all secondary pupils will be asked to wear masks, including in class.
In Wales, face coverings must be worn by secondary school students and staff everywhere outside the classroom.
Secondary school students in Northern Ireland are required to wear face coverings both inside and outside the classroom. 
Attendance will be compulsory for pupils in England - meaning they should not miss school without a valid reason.
Students who are shielding have been asked to remain at home for a bit longer.
Pupils in primary schools in Scotland will return full-time from 15 March. There will also be a phased return of secondary students from the same date.
Wales' youngest students began returning in February and all primary school students will go back by 15 March. All secondary school students will return from 12 April.
In Northern Ireland, primary school children in years 1-3 are back at school. Secondary school pupils in years 12-14 will also return to class on 22 March. There are no dates for other children to return.
After-school clubs and wrap-around childcare will only be available for some pupils for this term - for instance, vulnerable children, or those whose parents have to work, or have medical needs. 
The government says it hopes they will reopen in full by the beginning of the summer term, but no earlier than 12 April, as part of stage two of its "roadmap" out of lockdown.
In England, A-levels, AS levels and GCSE exams have been cancelled and teachers' estimated grades will be used instead. 
Results will be published earlier in August to allow time to appeal.
Primary school SATs will not go ahead this year, nor will phonics or timetable testing.
In Scotland, grades will be based on teacher assessment. Welsh students will have their grades determined by teachers, based on evidence such as mock exams and coursework.
In Northern Ireland, schools will have to submit the grades they think pupils should be awarded at the end of May.
