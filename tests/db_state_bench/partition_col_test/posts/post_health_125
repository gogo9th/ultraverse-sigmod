South Africa coronavirus variant: What is the risk?The "largest surge testing operation to date" is beginning in south London to hunt for any new cases of Covid caused by the South African variant. 
Some 44 cases have already been confirmed in Wandsworth and Lambeth, along with 30 probable ones. 
Experts say that this variant of concern - along with a few others - may be able to get round some of the protection offered by vaccines or previous Covid infection, although existing jabs should still work to stop severe illness. 
A real-world data study in Israel - not yet peer-reviewed - found some people who had been fully vaccinated against Covid still caught the South Africa variant.
All viruses, including the one that causes Covid-19, constantly mutate into new versions or variants.
These tiny genetic changes happen as the virus makes new copies of itself to spread and thrive. 
Most are inconsequential, and a few can even be harmful to the virus's survival, but some variants can make the virus more infectious or threatening to the host - humans. 
The South African variant, also known as 501.V2 or B.1.351, has some significant changes that experts are studying.
Some of the changes involve the virus's spike protein - the part that gains the virus entry into human cells. It is also the bit that vaccines are designed around, which is why experts are concerned about these particular mutations.
The South African variant carries a mutation, called N501Y, that appears to make it more contagious or easy to spread. 
Another mutation, called E484K, could help the virus dodge a person's immune system and may affect how well coronavirus vaccines work. 
There is no evidence that the South Africa variant causes more serious illness for the vast majority of people who become infected.
As with the original version, the risk is highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions.
But there are concerns it can spread more readily and vaccines may not work quite as well against it. 
Current vaccines are designed around original Covid, but should still offer some protection against new variants. 
It is too soon to know exactly how much protection they give, until more tests are completed, although it is extremely unlikely the mutations would render vaccines useless. 
Trials of Novavax, Janssen and the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines in South Africa, where B.1.351 is circulating, suggest the variant can escape some immunity and may not stop infections. 
But experts say vaccines should still offer protection against severe and life-threatening Covid-19 illness. 
Results from Moderna suggest its shot is still effective against the South Africa variant, although the immune response may not be as strong or prolonged. 
Even in the worst case scenario, vaccines can be redesigned and tweaked to provide a better match in a matter or weeks or months, if necessary.
It is already the dominant virus variant in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces of South Africa. 
At least 20 other countries including Austria, Norway and Japan, have also found cases.
In the UK, 533 cases of the variant have been found and there is extra testing happening in affected areas to stop the spread.
Travel is now banned from many countries in southern Africa, as well as Tanzania and Democratic Republic of Congo.
Targeted testing in the community is also taking place in some parts of the country. 
Scientists are also working to update existing vaccines to make them a better match for variants, such as the South Africa one.
Prof James Naismith, Director of the Rosaline Franklin Institute, said: "If the South Africa variant has really taken off, and we will probably know in about two to three weeks, then we may need to pause reopening a little bit."
