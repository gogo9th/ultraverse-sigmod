What are the rules for travelling to green, amber and red list countries?Malta, Madeira and the Balearic Islands are among the destinations added to the travel green list.
Holidaymakers will no longer have to self-isolate on their return to the UK from them.
The government's green list now includes Malta, Madeira, and the Balearics. They are joined by a number of UK overseas territories, including Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Antigua, Barbuda, Dominica, Barbados and Grenada.
However all these additions - apart from Malta - will be on the "green watchlist", which means that they are at risk of being moved to amber. Israel has also moved to the watchlist.
The government says people should "take extra consideration" when booking holidays to these destinations. It also says "if there is a sudden change in conditions, a country or territory may be moved between lists without warning".
Six nations have been added to the red list - the Dominican Republic, Eritrea, Haiti, Mongolia, Tunisia and Uganda.
The green list is made up of a small number of destinations.
If you're returning from a green list country, you must:
You do not need to quarantine unless your day-two test is positive, or NHS Test & Trace says you have travelled with someone who tested positive.
The vast majority of countries are on the amber list.
The government advises people not to travel to amber destinations, although it is not against the law.
If returning from an amber list country, you must:
It may be possible to end quarantine early in England if you pay for an additional test under the test-to-release scheme.
Senior executives arriving from amber countries will be able to leave quarantine in England if they are undertaking a specific business activity which will bring "significant economic benefit" to the country. 
Red list countries are those the UK government says present the highest risk from Covid, and should not be visited "except in the most extreme of circumstances".
Dozens of countries are on the red list, including India, Pakistan, Turkey, Brazil and South Africa. If you have been in one in the last 10 days, you can only enter the UK if you are a UK or Irish national, or UK resident. 
If you're returning from a red list country, you must:
Rates are: 
All countries go onto the amber list unless there is evidence to suggest they should be on the green or red lists.
Most popular tourist destinations are on the amber list.
The decision is taken by ministers, based on advice from the Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC), which looks at the Covid situation in each country. 
The lists are reviewed every three weeks. The rules are broadly the same for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Destinations have different entry rules, which can change at short notice. The government has information which you can check before travelling.

The EU Digital COVID Certificate will be available from 1 July:
The government had expressed hopes to scrap quarantine for people travelling back from amber list countries, who have had both Covid jabs.
It said this would happen "later in the summer", with further announcements expected in July.
Before returning to the UK you need to pay for a private test with high accuracy, such as a PCR or antigen test. Further tests are  required after you return.
In the UK, tests can be bought from approved providers. You can also find lists of providers in some destinations on UK government travel pages.
Failure to provide proof of a negative test before travelling to England could result in a Â£500 fine. 
A limited number of direct flights from red list countries are operating, as part of a trial at Heathrow and Birmingham airports.
The airports have "dedicated facilities" to keep red list passengers separate from other arrivals.
Anyone planning to visit an amber or red list country should check their proposed destination on the FCO country advice pages.
If the FCO advises against travel, insurance would almost certainly be invalid. 
If not, the cost of medical treatment abroad would be covered, usually including Covid.
But few policies, including those for green list countries, will cover your costs if you contract Covid and can't fly home.
