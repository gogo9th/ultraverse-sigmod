Teach pelvic floor lessons in school, say guidelinesGirls aged 12 to 17 should be taught in school how to do pelvic floor exercises, according to new draft health guidelines. 
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says it could help them avoid issues such as incontinence later in life. 
The exercises are simple - although they can take practice - and can be done anywhere and at any time. 
NICE suggests they be added to classes covering sex and relationships. 
Prof Gillian Leng, chief executive of NICE, said: "Improving women's awareness of pelvic floor health and encouraging them to practise pelvic floor muscle exercises throughout their lives is the most effective way to prevent pelvic floor dysfunction.
"Pelvic floor dysfunction is a common and often debilitating set of symptoms that can result in many issues for women."
In severe cases, a weak pelvic floor can cause prolapse, where organs in the pelvis, such as the bladder, slip down from their normal position and bulge into the vagina.
