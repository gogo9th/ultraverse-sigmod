Covid: What's happening with universities as lockdown eases?University students in England have been told that they will be allowed to return to face-to-face teaching - but no earlier than 17 May. 
About one million higher education students - close to 50% of the total number - are still thought to be receiving all their tuition online. 
Universities minister Michelle Donelan said the timing was a "cautious approach to the easing of restrictions".
"The movement of students across the country poses a risk for the transmission of the virus, particularly because of the higher prevalence and rates of transmission of new variants," she said.
She urged students who had returned to university accommodation to remain there, and "not move back and forward" between their permanent home and student home during term time.
University leaders have lobbied for all students to go back in April, at the start of the summer term. 
They say it is unfair to keep restrictions on campuses when shops are open.
The UCU lecturers' union, which opposed an earlier return, says it would be more "honest" to accept that many courses would stay online until the autumn.
Restarting in-person activities in mid-May makes "no sense" as most lectures and seminars will already have finished, it says.
The National Union of Students says it is pleased that young people can at least make necessary arrangements to access their learning and accommodation.
It will depend on the university or higher education college, and the course.
Some universities have already decided to keep some courses fully online for the remainder of the academic year.
Universities should shortly be in touch with students with specific information on how the latest government guidance will affect them. 
Since the start of 2021, universities have been required to offer testing to students whether or not they have Covid symptoms. 
Returning students will be offered their first three Covid tests under supervision on campus.
After then, they will be asked to self-test.
No. The government says university students in England must still pay full tuition fees, even if courses are taught online.
The maximum UK university tuition fee is currently £9,250 a year.
Many students feel the fees are too high, given what they have experienced on their courses during the pandemic. 
An online petition, calling for tuition fees to be cut to £3,000, has received more than 580,000 signatures.
Students who live in Scotland currently pay no tuition fees to attend a Scottish university. However, those from the rest of the UK are charged. 
Halls of residence
Many university-owned halls of residence and privately-run Purpose-Built Student Accommodation (PBSA) have let students terminate contracts early without any charges, if they have left accommodation because of Covid-19. 
Some students have benefited from waived or discounted rent - but others have had to pay, even if they have been unable to stay at university.
Any rebate offered is a local decision for universities.
Private rented
Some landlords have negotiated rent reductions or agreed that students can be released early from contracts, but there is no legal obligation on them to do so.
Unless your landlord agrees to end your tenancy early, you will be expected to keep paying rent until the end of your contract, says the Citizens Advice service.
If you live with other people, it's important you all keep paying your rent. 
If you all signed the same agreement, it's possible you have a joint tenancy. This means if one person stops paying their rent, everyone else might have to make up the difference.. 
If someone signed the contract as a guarantor for you or another tenant, they might also become responsible for unpaid rent. 
Getting help
If you think your accommodation provider is treating you unfairly, you can raise the issue officially - if your landlord has agreed to abide by the accommodation codes of practice.
The government has not introduced specific financial help for student rent payments in England, but students (in both university-owned or private accommodation) may be able to access university hardship funds.
An additional £15m for student hardship has now been announced by Ms Donelan - in addition to £70m already distributed in the previous financial year.
Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) says almost two-thirds of students have experienced a decline in their mental health this academic year.
Universities are experiencing unprecedented levels of demand for mental health support services, says Universities UK.
Many colleges and most universities have a free and confidential in-house counselling service.
The BBC Action Line lists several helplines.
Student Minds is the UK's student mental health charity.
