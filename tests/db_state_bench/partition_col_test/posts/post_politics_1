Sarah Everard: Met chief under pressure over Clapham vigil policingThe head of the Met Police is under pressure to explain her officers' actions during a vigil in south London on Saturday in memory of Sarah Everard.
Police were seen grabbing and leading women away from the event in handcuffs.
London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he was "urgently seeking an explanation" from Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick, while Home Secretary Priti Patel has asked the Met for a report on what happened.
Ms Patel is expected to receive the report by the end of Sunday. 
Police said four arrests were made at the vigil to "protect people's safety".
Several hundred people gathered on Clapham Common on Saturday evening to pay tribute to 33-year-old - whose death has prompted a public debate over women's safety - despite Covid restrictions.
The official vigil had been called off earlier in the day after organisers said the force had failed to "constructively engage" on how it could be held in a Covid-secure way. 
Organisers Reclaim These Streets had urged mourners to light candles and shine other lights on their doorsteps at 21:30 GMT - to coincide with the time Ms Everard was last seen on 3 March.
One video posted online from the vigil at Clapham Common showed officers removing women who were standing by the bandstand. 
Cries of "shame on you" and "let them go" could be heard from onlookers. The video showed them being put in a police van and driven away.
Jamie Klingler, from Reclaim These Streets, which had been organising the official vigil, said the event would have been "a lot safer" if it had been held officially, adding the group had 50 stewards who were "trained and ready to go". 
"We told the Met that it was going to be worse if we didn't have the organisation that we already had planned that was Covid-safe," she said.  
The group added in a statement that it was asking Dame Cressida "to meet us urgently" to explain the actions taken by police. 
The Met defended its response to the vigil, saying it was the "only responsible thing to do" to ensure public safety. But the force added that a review will be carried out to see if "lessons can be learned".
Home Office minister Victoria Atkins told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show the scenes were "incredibly upsetting", adding that it was "right" the force "explain their actions - both to the democratically elected politicians and the public". 
She told Sky News the government hopes to be "hearing explanations" from Dame Cressida "in the hours and days to come".
Asked whether the Met Police commissioner should leave her post, Ms Atkins added: "I really, really want to support the home secretary in her request to have a report from Cressida.
"The police have got a tough job in policing the coronavirus pandemic more generally at the moment."
Labour's shadow domestic violence minister, Jess Phillips, said the force had "got it wrong at every single turn".
She told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: "There are a million ways that could have been organised, but the police put their foot down before they put their boot in and at every stage they made the wrong call."
Sadiq Khan, the Labour Mayor of London, said the scenes were "unacceptable" and that he was "urgently seeking an explanation" from the commissioner.
Victims Commissioner for England and Wales Dame Vera Baird QC said there was no real prospect of police successfully intervening in the crowd in Clapham on Saturday night, describing the circling of the bandstand as "quasi military".
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the scenes were "deeply disturbing", while Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has called for Commissioner Dame Cressida to resign.
Conservative MP Caroline Nokes, who chairs the Commons Women and Equalities Select Committee, tweeted.: "In this country we police by consent - not by trampling the tributes to a woman who was murdered and dragging other women to the ground. Badly misjudged by #metpolice." 
Delivering a statement in the early hours of Sunday, Met Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball said hundreds of people were "packed tightly together", posing a risk of transmitting Covid-19.
"Police must act for people's safety, this is the only responsible thing to do," she said in a statement.
"We absolutely did not want to be in a position where enforcement action was necessary. But we were placed in this position because of the over-riding need to protect people's safety."
On Sunday, people continued to visit the bandstand on the common to pay their respects to Ms Everard. 
The BBC's Emily Unia, who has been at the scene, said there had been a "steady stream" of people visiting who had laid flowers and lit candles and stopped for a "moment of reflection". 
Among those who took part in the doorstep vigil were Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his fianc√©e, Carrie Symonds, who lit a candle and placed it in front of No 10.
Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted a picture of a candle in her home, while Wales's First Minister Mark Drakeford encouraged people to "ignite a fire for change".
Over the course of Saturday people had visited the bandstand on Clapham Common to lay flowers and pay their respects.
The Duchess of Cambridge made a private visit on Saturday afternoon, and was seen pausing at the bandstand.
Earlier on Saturday, Met Police officer Wayne Couzens, 48, appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court charged with Ms Everard's kidnap and murder.
The 33-year-old disappeared when walking home to Brixton from Clapham in south London on 3 March.
Mr Couzens was remanded in custody to appear again at the Old Bailey on 16 March.
